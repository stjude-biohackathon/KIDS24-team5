Is the first paragraph able to give a general background on the broader research area? Please rate it out of 5,"Heterotrimeric G proteins transduce a vast variety of extracellular stimuli, including hormones, ions, organic molecules, and light into the regulation of intracellular �effectors� to generate cellular responses (Neves et al., 2002). Collectively, G protein systems play a role in nearly every physiological process and in numerous pathologies (Heng et al., 2013; Kostenis et al., 2020; O�Hayre et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2018). G proteins are activated by the binding of GTP to the _ subunits (G_) that release them from inhibitory occlusion by the __ dimer (G__) (Glukhova et al., 2018; Lambert, 2008; Oldham et al., 2006; Syrovatkina et al., 2016). Mammalian genomes encode a conserved set of 16 G_ subunits, each possessing unique signaling properties and the ability to selectively engage a distinct set of effectors, including adenylate cyclases, phospholipase C isozymes, Rho guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs), and ion channels (Hubbard and Hepler, 2006; Marinissen and Gutkind, 2001; Wettschureck and Offermanns, 2005).","Heterotrimeric G proteins transduce a vast variety of extracellular stimuli, including hormones, ions, organic molecules, and light into the regulation of intracellular �effectors� to generate cellular responses (Neves et al., 2002).

The key determinant of G protein action in cells is their lifetime in an active state. Thus, the activation and deactivation of G proteins is tightly controlled and ought to occur with selectivity for individual G proteins to ensure the selectivity of downstream signaling (Siderovski and Willard, 2005; Syrovatkina et al., 2016; Wettschureck and Offermanns, 2005). Deciphering molecular mechanisms of this selectivity is of paramount importance for understanding how the signals are routed in the cells. A number of G protein activators have been described and demonstrated to act as GEFs on the G_ subunits with clear subtype selectivity (Cismowski et al., 1999; Garcia-Marcos et al., 2011; Tall et al., 2003). Among them, the largest class is the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) family (Fredriksson et al., 2003; Hilger et al., 2018; Mahoney and Sunahara, 2016). GPCRs exhibit clear preferences for activating particular G_ species, and there has been tremendous progress in understanding the molecular mechanisms in establishing this selectivity (Flock et al., 2017; Inoue et al., 2019; Masuho et al., 2015b; Okashah et al., 2019).
The opposing process of G protein deactivation occurs when G proteins hydrolyze guanosine triphosphate (GTP), a process assisted by the action of the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). The GAP action is essential for avoiding response saturation and for achieving temporal resolution dictated by individual physiological reactions (Ross, 2008). Most well-characterized GAPs for heterotrimeric G proteins belong to the regulator of G protein signaling (RGS) family, consisting of 20 canonical members in mammals (Dohlman and Thorner, 1997; Tesmer, 2009). RGS proteins bind to active G_ proteins and facilitate their GTPase activity, thereby accelerating the termination of G protein signaling (Berman et al., 1996b; Hunt et al., 1996; Ross and Wilkie, 2000; Saitoh et al., 1997; Watson et al., 1996). It is now well established that this action of RGS proteins is crucial for achieving the physiologically relevant timing and extent of GPCR signaling (Hollinger and Hepler, 2002; Kimple et al., 2011; Neubig, 2015). Accordingly, the loss of RGS-mediated control leads to a range of pathologies observed in mouse models (Bansal et al., 2007; Gaspari et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2010; Senese et al., 2020) and is increasingly associated with human diseases (Shamseldin et al., 2016; Squires et al., 2018). Studies in several members of the RGS family indicate that they exert considerable selectivity in recognizing G_ (Heximer et al., 1997; Snow et al., 1998; Soundararajan et al., 2008; Tesmer, 2009; Wang et al., 1998). There has been significant progress documenting cases of selective RGS-G_ interactions (Hollinger and Hepler, 2002), analyzing the structural basis for this selectivity (Soundararajan et al., 2008; Taylor et al., 2016), and mapping amino acid residues involved in specific recognition (Kimple et al., 2009; Kosloff et al., 2011). Although these studies provide insights into the selectivity of RGS action for isolated cases, a comprehensive understanding of the complete landscape of G_ preferences of RGS proteins is still lacking.
This study presents a map of G_ selectivity for all canonical RGS proteins. We monitored the temporal regulation of GPCR-mediated G protein signaling and quantitatively characterized the GAP activity of the RGS proteins, testing nearly all of the theoretically possible G_-RGS pairings (300 combinations). Using the functional activity as a readout in the context of a physiologically relevant cellular environment allowed us ot document the preferences of RGS proteins for G_ substrates, revealing pairings and disallowed combinations. This information led to the identification of molecular determinants involved in the selectivity of G_-RGS recognition. Applying computational algorithms, we also show how these determinants have evolved and can be used to create designer RGS proteins with novel selectivity profiles. Analysis of human genomic data further suggests that genetic variations in RGS selectivity determinants may contribute to non-disease traits, pathological dysregulation of GPCR signaling, and variable responsiveness to drug treatments.","{""score"" :4, ""comment"" : ""The first paragraph provides a good general background on the broader research area of G proteins, mentioning their role in various physiological processes and pathologies.
